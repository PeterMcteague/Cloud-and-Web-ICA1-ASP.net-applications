## Readme

This is a collection of asp.net applications created for a University assessment. The applications deliver information 
in a variety of ways through web browser get requests and content can be modified using post requests. Some applications also consume web API's and SQL Databases.

It should be noted that whilst Task 3 and 4 work, they are slightly rushed as my visual studio was not compiling the latest version of the code and I had to restart the project, copying in each file. They have some code in odd places and very few-no comments, things which I would never do if it wasn't for University deadlines.
